# competitive-programming-helper README

This extension helps you to quickly run codeforces testcases for a given problem automatically. You can also add custom testcases to the generated ```.testcases``` file. If the file you are testing in ```A.cpp``` then the generated testcases file is ```A.cpp.testcases```, in which you can add your own testcases.


## Usage

The first line of your C++ code should be a comment containing the URL of the codeforces page. The comment should be single line, ie,  start with ```//``` and not ```/*```
